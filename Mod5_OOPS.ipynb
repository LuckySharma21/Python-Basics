        "Ans-->In Python, encapsulation is achieved by binding the data (attributes) and methods together inside a class and restricting access to the data to protect it from unauthorized use. By default, all attributes and methods in Python are public and can be accessed from anywhere. To indicate restricted access, Python provides naming conventions: a single underscore _ before an attribute makes it protected, suggesting it is intended for internal use only, while a double underscore __ makes an attribute private, preventing direct access from outside the class. Private attributes can still be accessed indirectly through getter and setter methods defined inside the class. This approach ensures that the internal state of an object is hidden and secure, while still allowing controlled interaction with the object’s data."

        "A static method in Python is a method that belongs to a class but does not take the instance (self) or the class (cls) as its first argument. This means it cannot access or modify class variables or instance variables directly. It behaves just like a normal function but is kept inside a class for better organization. Static methods are usually used for utility or helper tasks that are logically related to the class but do not need to work with the class or its objects.\n",

Unlike static methods, class methods can access and modify class-level variables that are shared across all objects of the class. They are often used when you want to perform operations that affect the class as a whole rather than a single object. Class methods provide a way to work with the overall behavior or state of the class."
